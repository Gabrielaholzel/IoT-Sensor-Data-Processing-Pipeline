# Project-IoT-Sensor-Data-Processing-Pipeline
This serverless pipeline efficiently processes and stores large volumes of real-time IoT data. Built using AWS technologies like Lambda, Kinesis, Redshift, and S3, it demonstrates my ability to design and implement scalable, data-driven architectures that handle high-throughput sensor data.
